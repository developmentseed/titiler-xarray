# Manual smoke testing a dev deployment

What to check by hand after a `deploy-dev` labeled deployment goes live,
beyond the automated tile requests in `scripts/test_deployment.py`. All
examples use `API_URL` for the deployed endpoint.

While the `deploy-dev` label is on the PR, **every later push redeploys**.
Re-resolve `API_URL` and re-run from the top after any push you make
mid-session.

## Find the endpoint

The deploy job prints it: open the workflow run for "CDK Deploy Dev
Workflow", expand the "Smoke-test deployed Icechunk tiles" step, and the
first line resolves `API_URL` from `cdk-outputs.json`. It is also the
`Endpoint` output on the CloudFormation stack (`<stack-name>-<stage>` in
the dev account).

```bash
export API_URL=https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

## Baseline

```bash
curl -sf "$API_URL/healthz"
uv run python scripts/test_deployment.py --api-url "$API_URL"
```

The script requests one tile from every public store plus the TEMPO
earthdata case. If it passes, most of what follows is confirmation and
poking at the parts a single tile can't show.

The interactive API docs live at `$API_URL/api.html`.

## The earthdata path (TEMPO)

TEMPO is the one store that exercises the full credential chain: Secrets
Manager secret → EDL login → identity probe → `s3credentials` exchange →
virtual chunk reads from `asdc-prod-protected`. Test it in this order —
each step needs strictly more of the chain working than the one before.

HCHO and NO2 are separate icechunk repositories with independent time
axes and different variable sets; `scripts/test_deployment.py` requests
one tile from each. The walkthrough below is parameterized — set one of
these blocks and run the steps, then set the other and run them again:

```bash
# HCHO (total column)
TEMPO="s3://airquality-data-store-develop/tempo/hcho/v04-trial"
VAR=vertical_column
CMAP=viridis
```

```bash
# NO2 (tropospheric column)
TEMPO="s3://airquality-data-store-develop/tempo/no2/v04-trial"
VAR=vertical_column_troposphere
CMAP=magma_r
```

The colormaps and the `rescale=0,3e16` used below reproduce the GIBS
rendering that Worldview uses for these products (both GIBS palettes run
0→3.0e16 molecules/cm²; the HCHO ramp is viridis, the NO2 ramp is
reversed magma), so tiles here and the Worldview check further down are
visually comparable. Values above 3e16 clamp to the top color in both.

1. **Metadata** — needs store-bucket IAM only, no EDL:

   ```bash
   curl -sf "$API_URL/variables?url=$TEMPO"
   curl -sf "$API_URL/info?url=$TEMPO&variable=$VAR" | head -c 400
   ```

   Expect `$VAR` in the variable list. A failure here is an IAM
   or store problem (reader role permissions on
   `airquality-data-store-develop`, or the store prefix has graduated past
   `v04-trial`), not an EDL problem.

2. **Take the scan time from the store** — the time axis grows all day, so
   read it instead of hardcoding one:

   ```bash
   T=$(curl -sf "$API_URL/info?url=$TEMPO&variable=$VAR&show_times=true" \
     | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["times"][-1])')
   echo "$T"
   ```

   `show_times` is single-url only. Every step below selects with
   `sel=time=nearest::$T`, so an approximate timestamp still resolves —
   but starting from the newest scan means an empty tile is a swath
   question rather than a stale-timestamp one.

3. **A tile** — needs the whole chain:

   ```bash
   TILE="url=$TEMPO&variable=$VAR&sel=time=nearest::$T&rescale=0,3e16&colormap_name=$CMAP"
   time curl -so /tmp/tempo.png -w '%{http_code} %{content_type}\n' \
     "$API_URL/tiles/WebMercatorQuad/4/3/6.png?$TILE"
   ```

   Expect `200 image/png`. The first request on a cold Lambda is the slow
   one (secret fetch, EDL login, identity probe).

4. **The warm path, and a second tile** — re-run step 3 (much faster, the
   credential cache is warm), then a neighbouring tile, which proves chunk
   reads past the first manifest entry rather than one lucky chunk:

   ```bash
   curl -so /tmp/tempo2.png -w '%{http_code}\n' \
     "$API_URL/tiles/WebMercatorQuad/4/4/6.png?$TILE"
   ```

5. **A point value** — same chain, different read path:

   ```bash
   curl -sf "$API_URL/point/-95,35?url=$TEMPO&variable=$VAR&sel=time=nearest::$T"
   ```

   A masked/nan result means `-95,35` fell outside that scan's swath; try
   `-90,38`.

6. **Look at it** — open the map viewer in a browser (the quotes matter:
   unquoted `&` is a shell operator):

   ```bash
   echo "$API_URL/WebMercatorQuad/map.html?$TILE"        # print the URL, or
   open "$API_URL/WebMercatorQuad/map.html?$TILE"        # open it (macOS)
   ```

   TEMPO covers North America; pan there. Tiles outside the scan's swath
   are transparent — that's data coverage, not an error.

### Sanity-check against Worldview

NASA Worldview renders the same products from GIBS and is the stable
reference for "should this tile have data here?". Layer IDs (verified
against Worldview's config):

- HCHO: `TEMPO_L3_Formaldehyde_Vertical_Column`
- NO2: `TEMPO_L3_NO2_Vertical_Column_Troposphere`

Build a permalink for the scan you tested (swap the layer ID for NO2):

```bash
WV_TIME=$(python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.argv[1][:19] + 'Z')" "$T")
open "https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=-135,15,-55,55&l=TEMPO_L3_Formaldehyde_Vertical_Column,Coastlines_15m,BlueMarble_NextGeneration&t=$WV_TIME"
```

Compare swath position and spatial patterns, not exact pixels:

- Worldview may serve the near-real-time stream while `v04-trial` is
  standard processing, so scan times and values can differ slightly.
- GIBS imagery is quality-filtered (clouds, `main_data_quality_flag`);
  the unfiltered column shows data in noisy areas where Worldview shows
  gaps. The stores keep the quality variables, so `where` closes most of
  the visual difference:

  ```bash
  curl -so /tmp/tempo-filtered.png -w '%{http_code}\n' \
    "$API_URL/tiles/WebMercatorQuad/4/3/6.png?$TILE&where=main_data_quality_flag==0&where=eff_cloud_fraction<0.2"
  ```

  (GIBS's exact filter recipe isn't published; flag==0 plus a cloud cap
  is a close approximation, tune to taste.)
- If Worldview shows data where a tile is empty **for the same scan
  hour**, that's a real finding.

The instrument team's quicklooks at <https://tempo.si.edu/> are a second
reference for recent scans.

### TileJSON for frontends

Everything a map client needs comes from the `tilejson.json` endpoint,
with the same query parameters as a tile request:

```bash
curl -sf "$API_URL/WebMercatorQuad/tilejson.json?$TILE"
```

which returns (bounds/zooms come from the store):

```json
{
  "tilejson": "3.0.0",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scheme": "xyz",
  "tiles": [
    "https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tiles/WebMercatorQuad/{z}/{x}/{y}?url=s3%3A%2F%2Fairquality-data-store-develop%2Ftempo%2Fhcho%2Fv04-trial&variable=vertical_column&sel=time%3Dnearest%3A%3A2026-08-31T16%3A38%3A59&rescale=0%2C3e16&colormap_name=viridis&tilesize=512"
  ],
  "minzoom": 0,
  "maxzoom": 5,
  "bounds": [...],
  "center": [...],
  "band_descriptions": [["b1", "..."]],
  "data_type": "float32"
}
```

Hand the `tilejson.json` URL itself to frontend devs — Mapbox GL /
MapLibre (`addSource` with `"url"`), Leaflet, and OpenLayers all consume
it directly, and the `tiles` template inside carries every query
parameter. Two things to flag to them:

- The `sel` time is baked into the URL. A dashboard that should follow
  the growing time axis must re-resolve the newest scan (step 2) and
  rebuild the URL, or drop `sel` to always serve the store's default
  slice.
- The tile template is only valid while the store prefix exists;
  `v04-trial` graduating will 5xx every tile.

### Credential refresh (the one failure only time reveals)

The DAAC `s3credentials` exchange returns hourly credentials, and icechunk
re-invokes the refresh callable at chunk-read time as they near expiry. A
fresh deploy never exercises that: every step above runs inside the first
credentials' lifetime.

Leave the deployment idle for 55+ minutes, then re-run step 3. A `500`
that appears **only** here is the refresh callable failing, not the initial
login — the rest of the chain already proved itself. Cold-starting in
between hides it, since a new sandbox logs in from scratch; the test only
means something against a Lambda that stayed warm.

### Reading the failure modes

The service maps credential failures deliberately; the status code tells
you whose problem it is.

| Response | Meaning | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `403` with EULA and application URLs in the body | The EDL identity in the secret hasn't accepted the ASDC EULA or application terms | Log in to EDL as the service identity and accept them, then retry — no redeploy needed |
| `500` "The service's Earthdata Login credentials were rejected" | The secret's token is expired (~60-day lifetime) or wrong | Rotate the secret; the Lambda re-reads it within ~10 minutes, or immediately on a cold start |
| `500` "Authentication with Earthdata Login failed" | EDL itself rejected the login (bad username/password secret, EDL outage) | Check the secret's contents and EDL status |
| `500` "icechunk storage error" | The store itself couldn't be read | Check reader-role S3 permissions and the store prefix |
| Metadata works but every tile fails | Chunk-read-time credential refresh is failing while store metadata (read with ambient IAM) still works | Same 403/500 triage as above — the wrapped error keeps the status distinction |
| `501` "File format identification for extension  is not implemented" (note the empty extension) | Nothing was found at the url: `identify_storage_backend` listed the prefix, got zero objects, and fell back to treating it as a single file | Fix the url, or check the store prefix still exists — this is never a format problem |
| `500` "no non-interactive EDL login strategy available" | The Lambda has no `TITILER_MULTIDIM_EARTHDATA_SECRET_ARN`, so credential loading is a permanent no-op — or the first secret fetch failed and this request landed in the 60s retry window | Check the deployed env var (below); if it is set, look for `could not read the earthdata secret` in the logs and treat it as a `GetSecretValue` failure |

Details in the response bodies are intentionally generic; the specifics
(raw DAAC responses, endpoints) are in the Lambda's CloudWatch logs.

## Checking the reader role's permissions

The Lambda runs as an externally managed role imported with
`mutable=False` (`infrastructure/aws/cdk/app.py`), so CDK cannot grant it
anything — every permission must already exist on the role before the
deploy. Two grants matter:

- `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the EDL secret (plus `kms:Decrypt`
  if it is encrypted with a CMK)
- `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` on the icechunk store bucket

The role does **not** need access to `asdc-prod-protected`: those are the
virtual chunk reads, and they use the DAAC temporary credentials from the
`s3credentials` exchange, not ambient IAM. Only the store bucket is read
with the role (`from_env=True` in `opener_icechunk`).

Start from what is actually deployed rather than the GitHub Actions
variables:

```bash
FN=<function-name>
ROLE=$(aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name "$FN" --query Role --output text)
SECRET=$(aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name "$FN" \
  --query 'Environment.Variables.TITILER_MULTIDIM_EARTHDATA_SECRET_ARN' --output text)
```

A `None` for `$SECRET` is itself the answer to a
`no non-interactive EDL login strategy available` failure: the stack was
synthesized without `TITILER_MULTIDIM_EARTHDATA_SECRET_ARN` (an unset
`vars.EARTHDATA_SECRET_ARN` expands to an empty string, and
`StackSettings.model_post_init` then omits the variable entirely). Set the
Actions variable and redeploy; the ARN is read lazily per request, so
nothing else needs clearing.

### Assume the role and try it

The only check that covers identity policy, bucket policy, KMS key policy
and SCPs together:

```bash
CREDS=$(aws sts assume-role --role-arn "$ROLE" --role-session-name perm-check --query Credentials)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(jq -r .AccessKeyId <<<"$CREDS") \
       AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(jq -r .SecretAccessKey <<<"$CREDS") \
       AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(jq -r .SessionToken <<<"$CREDS")

# secret + KMS, in the secret's own region (what _secrets_client does)
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id "$SECRET" \
  --region "$(cut -d: -f4 <<<"$SECRET")" --query ARN

# ListBucket — the exact call identify_storage_backend makes
aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket airquality-data-store-develop \
  --prefix tempo/ --max-keys 3 --query 'Contents[].Key'

# GetObject, on a real key from the listing above
aws s3api head-object --bucket airquality-data-store-develop --key <key-from-above>
```

An `AccessDenied` names the missing action; a missing `kms:Decrypt`
surfaces on the first call as an `AccessDeniedException` mentioning KMS
rather than Secrets Manager. `unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` when done.

### When the trust policy won't let you assume it

```bash
aws iam simulate-principal-policy --policy-source-arn "$ROLE" \
  --action-names secretsmanager:GetSecretValue --resource-arns "$SECRET" \
  --query 'EvaluationResults[].[EvalActionName,EvalDecision]' --output text

aws iam simulate-principal-policy --policy-source-arn "$ROLE" \
  --action-names s3:ListBucket --resource-arns arn:aws:s3:::airquality-data-store-develop \
  --context-entries ContextKeyName=s3:prefix,ContextKeyType=string,ContextKeyValues=tempo/ \
  --query 'EvaluationResults[].[EvalActionName,EvalDecision]' --output text

aws iam simulate-principal-policy --policy-source-arn "$ROLE" \
  --action-names s3:GetObject --resource-arns 'arn:aws:s3:::airquality-data-store-develop/tempo/x' \
  --query 'EvaluationResults[].[EvalActionName,EvalDecision]' --output text
```

The resource ARN shapes differ — a **bucket** ARN for `ListBucket`, an
**object** ARN for `GetObject`; simulating `ListBucket` against an object
ARN returns a meaningless `implicitDeny`. And `allowed` here is not proof:
the simulator reads identity policies only, so it cannot see a bucket
policy `Deny` or a KMS key policy that omits the role.

### Is the secret even on a CMK?

```bash
aws secretsmanager describe-secret --secret-id "$SECRET" --query KmsKeyId
```

`null` or `alias/aws/secretsmanager` means the AWS-managed key —
`GetSecretValue` alone is enough. Any other key id is a CMK, and the role
needs both `kms:Decrypt` and an entry in the key policy
(`aws kms get-key-policy --key-id <id> --policy-name default`), usually
gated on `kms:ViaService=secretsmanager.<region>.amazonaws.com`.

## Freshness (expected behavior, not a bug)

Forward processing appends TEMPO scans continuously, but readers sit
behind CloudFront (`max-age=3600`). A missing newest scan within that
window is caching; it expires on its own.

## The public stores

The automated script covers one tile each. For a quick interactive check,
the same viewer works for any of them, e.g. virtual MUR:

```text
$API_URL/WebMercatorQuad/map.html?url=s3://nasa-eodc-public/icechunk/MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1-virtual-v2-p2&variable=analysed_sst&sel=time=2024-08-01T09:00:00.000000000&decode_times=true&rescale=273,325&colormap_name=thermal
```

## Notes

- Everything must run against the us-west-2 deployment: DAAC temporary S3
  credentials are region-locked, so a stack in another region 403s on
  chunk reads even with perfect auth.
- `histogram` and `statistics` endpoints exist too and read full arrays;
  they're heavier than a tile and not part of smoke testing.
